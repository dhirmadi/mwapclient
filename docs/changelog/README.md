### Feature-Based Architecture Refactoring (2025-07-13)

#### Overview
Major architectural refactoring to implement feature-based organization with atomic design principles.

#### Changes Made

**Directory Structure**
- ✅ Reorganized codebase into feature-based modules
- ✅ Implemented atomic design component hierarchy
- ✅ Separated shared utilities and components
- ✅ Created core application functionality layer

**Component Architecture**

- ✅ Implemented consistent testing patterns
- ✅ Created development guidelines and documentation
- ✅ Added code quality tools and workflows

### Authentication Race Condition Fix (2025-07-14)

#### Problem Identified
Role-based UI elements (like SuperAdmin quick actions) weren't displaying despite correct API responses because components rendered before authentication was fully ready.

#### Solution Implemented
- ✅ Enhanced authentication coordination using `isReady` state
- ✅ Added loading states while authentication initializes
- ✅ Implemented debug logging for troubleshooting
- ✅ Applied pattern consistently across all components

#### Code Changes
```typescript
// Before (problematic)
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { isSuperAdmin } = useAuth();
  return <div>{isSuperAdmin && <AdminPanel />}</div>;
};

// After (fixed)
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { isReady, isSuperAdmin } = useAuth();
  
  if (!isReady) {
    return <LoadingSpinner />;
  }
  
  return <div>{isSuperAdmin && <AdminPanel />}</div>;
};
```

#### Impact
- ✅ Fixed SuperAdmin quick actions display issue
- ✅ Improved user experience with proper loading states
- ✅ Established best practices for role-based UI coordination
- ✅ Prevented similar race conditions in future development
