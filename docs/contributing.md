# Contributing Guidelines

## Overview

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the MWAP Client! This document provides guidelines and best practices for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git
- Familiarity with React, TypeScript, and modern web development

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
5. Start development server: `npm run dev`

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Follow the [Developer Guidelines](./development/README.md)
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow atomic design principles for components
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Write tests for new functionality

### Commit Message Format
Use conventional commits format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

**Examples**:
```
feat(auth): add role-based route protection
fix(api): handle network timeout errors
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### Branch Naming
- **Feature**: `feature/feature-name`
- **Bug Fix**: `fix/bug-description`
- **Documentation**: `docs/documentation-update`
- **Refactor**: `refactor/component-restructure`

## Contributing Process

### 1. Issue Creation
Before starting work:
- Check existing issues to avoid duplication
- Create a detailed issue describing the problem or feature
- Wait for maintainer approval before starting work

### 2. Development
- Follow established architectural patterns
- Implement features according to specifications
- Write comprehensive tests
- Ensure code passes all quality checks

### 3. Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run type checking
npm run type-check

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run build to ensure no build errors
npm run build
```

### 4. Pull Request
- Create a clear, descriptive PR title
- Fill out the PR template completely
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Ensure all CI checks pass
- Request review from maintainers

## Code Review Process

### For Contributors
- Respond to feedback promptly
- Make requested changes in separate commits
- Keep discussions focused and professional
- Test changes thoroughly before requesting re-review

### Review Criteria
- Code follows established patterns and standards
- Functionality works as expected
- Tests provide adequate coverage
- Documentation is updated if necessary
- No breaking changes without proper migration path

## Types of Contributions

### Bug Fixes
- Identify root cause and impact
- Implement minimal, focused fix
- Add regression tests
- Update documentation if necessary

### New Features
- Follow feature specification exactly
- Implement according to architectural guidelines
- Include comprehensive tests
- Update relevant documentation
- Consider backward compatibility

### Documentation
- Ensure accuracy and completeness
- Include practical examples
- Update related sections
- Follow documentation standards

### Performance Improvements
- Measure performance impact
- Ensure changes don't break functionality
- Include performance tests if applicable
- Document performance gains

## Security Guidelines

### Security Considerations
- Never commit sensitive information (tokens, passwords, keys)
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper authentication checks
- Report security vulnerabilities privately

### Security Review Process
- All security-related changes require additional review
- Security vulnerabilities should be reported via private channels
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Requirements
- Unit tests for all new functions and components
- Integration tests for complex features
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Maintain or improve test coverage

### Test Structure
```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  it('should render correctly', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should handle user interactions', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    // Cleanup
  });
});
```

### Testing Best Practices
- Write descriptive test names
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Use appropriate testing utilities
- Mock external dependencies
- Clean up after tests

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Document complex functions and components
- Include usage examples
- Explain non-obvious business logic
- Keep documentation up to date

### API Documentation
- Document all new API endpoints
- Include request/response examples
- Specify error conditions
- Update OpenAPI specifications

### User Documentation
- Update user-facing documentation for new features
- Include screenshots and examples
- Consider different user roles and permissions
- Test documentation accuracy

## Release Process

### Version Management
- Follow semantic versioning (SemVer)
- Update version numbers appropriately
- Create release notes for significant changes
- Tag releases properly

### Deployment
- Ensure all tests pass
- Verify build process works correctly
- Test in staging environment
- Follow deployment checklist

## Community Guidelines
