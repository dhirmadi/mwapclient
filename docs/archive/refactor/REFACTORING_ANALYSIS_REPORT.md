## 1. Code Analysis Summary

### 1.1 Current Implementation State

**Technology Stack:** âœ… **EXCELLENT**
- React 19.1.0 with TypeScript (latest versions)
- Modern build tooling with Vite 6.3.5
- Comprehensive UI framework (Mantine 8.1.0 + Tailwind CSS 4.1.10)
- Robust state management (TanStack Query 5.80.7)
- Proper authentication (Auth0 React SDK 2.3.0)
- Form handling with validation (React Hook Form + Zod)

**Architecture Implementation:** ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL MISMATCH**
- **Documented:** Feature-based architecture with `/features`, `/shared`, `/core`
- **Actual:** Page-based organization with `/pages`, `/components`, `/hooks`
- **Impact:** Confusion for developers, maintenance difficulties, scalability issues

### 1.2 Critical Issues Identified

#### Issue 1: Data Fetching Reliability Problems ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**

**Location:** `src/hooks/useTenants.ts` (Lines 19, 31, 43)
```typescript
// PROBLEM: Conditional query execution prevents data loading
enabled: isSuperAdmin,  // Line 19 - Active tenants
enabled: isSuperAdmin,  // Line 31 - Archived tenants  
enabled: !isSuperAdmin, // Line 43 - Current tenant
```

**Impact:**
- SuperAdmins cannot access tenant data if role detection fails
- Non-SuperAdmins cannot access their own tenant data
- System appears broken with empty states when data should be available
- Race conditions between authentication and data fetching

#### Issue 2: API Response Format Inconsistencies ðŸ”´ **CRITICAL**

**Location:** `src/utils/api.ts` (Lines 107-111, 135-142)
```typescript
// PROBLEM: Complex workarounds for multiple response formats
if (response.data && response.data.success && response.data.data) {
  return response.data.data; // Format 1: Wrapped response
} else if (Array.isArray(response.data)) {
  return response.data; // Format 2: Direct array
} else {
  console.warn('Unexpected response format:', response.data);
  return []; // Fallback
}
```

**Impact:**
- Fragile API integration requiring complex fallback mechanisms
- Difficult to debug and maintain
- Inconsistent error handling across endpoints
- High risk of breaking changes

#### Issue 3: AuthContext Overload ðŸŸ¡ **MODERATE**

**Location:** `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` (Lines 6-17)
```typescript
// PROBLEM: Single context handling too many responsibilities
interface AuthContextType {
  // Authentication concerns
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  user: any;
  login: () => void;
  logout: () => void;
  getToken: () => Promise<string>;
  
  // Authorization concerns (should be separate)
  isSuperAdmin: boolean;
  isTenantOwner: boolean;
  roles: UserRolesResponse;
  hasProjectRole: () => boolean;
  
  // Loading state
  isLoading: boolean;
}
```

**Impact:**
- Tight coupling between authentication and authorization
- Performance issues due to unnecessary re-renders
- Difficult to test and maintain
- Violates single responsibility principle
