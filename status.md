# MWAP Frontend Development Plan

This document outlines the detailed plan for building the MWAP frontend application, including phases, tasks, and implementation strategies.

## üìã Project Overview

The MWAP frontend is a React application that provides a user interface for the MWAP backend API. It enables users to manage tenants, projects, cloud provider integrations, and files based on their role in the system.

   - Maintain a consistent development pattern across features

### State Management

1. **Server State**
   - Use React Query for all API data
   - Implement proper caching strategies
   - Handle loading and error states consistently

   - Keep component state local when possible
   - Use reducers for complex state logic
   - Implement proper state initialization

### Testing Strategy

1. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Write tests before implementation for critical components
   - Focus on behavior rather than implementation details
   - Use React Testing Library for component testing
   - Implement proper mocking for external dependencies

2. **Continuous Testing**
   - Run tests on every commit
   - Maintain high test coverage
   - Focus on critical paths and edge cases
   - Use snapshot testing for UI components

### Code Quality

1. **Code Standards**
   - Follow TypeScript best practices
   - Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Write clear, self-documenting code

2. **Review Process**
   - Conduct regular code reviews
   - Use pull requests for feature integration
   - Maintain documentation alongside code
   - Ensure adherence to project standards

## üìä Progress Tracking

We will track progress using GitHub Issues and Projects, with the following categories:

- **Backlog**: Tasks that are planned but not yet started
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on
- **Review**: Tasks completed and awaiting review
- **Done**: Tasks that are completed and merged

Each task will be assigned a priority level and estimated effort to help with planning and resource allocation.

## üîÑ Iteration Cycle

We will follow a two-week iteration cycle:

1. **Planning**: Define tasks for the iteration
2. **Development**: Implement features and fix bugs
3. **Testing**: Verify functionality and fix issues
4. **Review**: Conduct code reviews and make adjustments
5. **Deployment**: Deploy to staging environment
6. **Retrospective**: Review the iteration and identify improvements

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy

1. **Development Environment**
   - Local development with hot reloading
   - Mock API responses when needed
   - Feature flags for in-progress features

2. **Staging Environment**
   - Automated deployment from main branch
   - Integration with staging API
   - Testing of complete user flows

3. **Production Environment**

## üìù Conclusion

This development plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for building the MWAP frontend application. By following this structured approach, we will create a high-quality, maintainable, and user-friendly interface for the MWAP platform that meets all the requirements and provides a great user experience.
