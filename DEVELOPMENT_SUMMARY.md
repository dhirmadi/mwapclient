### Authentication Flow

1. User logs in via Auth0
2. Access token is retrieved and stored in localStorage
3. Token is attached to all API requests
4. User roles are fetched from the API
5. UI adapts based on user roles

### Role-Based Access Control

- **SuperAdmin**: Full access to all resources
- **TenantOwner**: Access to own tenant and all projects within it
- **ProjectManager**: Access to assigned projects only

### Validation

- Project creation requires user to have a tenant
- Proper error handling for API requests
- UI feedback for user actions

### Next Steps

1. Add comprehensive testing
2. Enhance error handling
3. Improve documentation
4. Add more advanced features like analytics
