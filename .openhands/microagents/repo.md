- **[Troubleshooting](../../docs/troubleshooting.md)** - Common issues and solutions
- **[Contributing](../../docs/contributing.md)** - Guidelines for contributing to the project

## API Documentation

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Always reference [API Documentation](../../docs/api/README.md) for complete details**

The application communicates with a RESTful API. Key documentation files:

- [`docs/api/README.md`](../../docs/api/README.md): Complete API integration guide
- [`docs/api/v3-openAPI-schema.md`](../../docs/api/v3-openAPI-schema.md): OpenAPI schema documentation
- [`docs/api/cloud-providers.md`](../../docs/api/cloud-providers.md): Cloud provider API documentation


### Key API Endpoints (v3)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: API Configuration Requirements**
- **API Base URL:** `/api` (configured in `src/shared/utils/api.ts`)
- **Vite Proxy Configuration:** Current setup in `vite.config.ts` is correct and must NOT be changed
- **Proxy Target:** `https://mwapss.shibari.photo/api/v1`
- **URL Rewriting:** Vite automatically rewrites `/api/*` requests to `/*` on the target server

**Example API Call Flow:**
1. Frontend makes request to: `/api/users/me/roles`
2. Vite proxy forwards to: `https://mwapss.shibari.photo/api/v1/users/me/roles`
3. Backend processes and returns wrapped response: `{success: true, data: {...}}`

- `/api/v1/tenants`: Tenant management
- `/api/v1/projects`: Project management
- `/api/v1/cloud-providers`: Cloud provider management
- `/api/v1/project-types`: Project type management
- `/api/v1/users`: User management
- `/api/v1/tenants/{tenantId}/integrations`: Cloud provider integrations
- File access is read-only through cloud provider integrations

## Authentication Flow

1. User visits the application
2. If unauthenticated, redirected to login page
3. Auth0 handles authentication
4. Upon successful login, user roles are fetched
5. User is directed to appropriate dashboard based on role

## Current Status and Architecture

### Completed Improvements

1. **‚úÖ Feature-Based Architecture**: Successfully refactored to feature-based organization
2. **‚úÖ API v3 Migration**: Updated all endpoints and types to match v3 API specification
3. **‚úÖ Consistent HTTP Methods**: All updates now use PATCH instead of PUT
4. **‚úÖ Type Safety**: All TypeScript types match API schemas exactly
5. **‚úÖ Cloud Provider Integration**: Fixed integration endpoints and OAuth token refresh

### Current Architecture Benefits

1. **Modular Organization**: Each feature is self-contained with its own hooks, pages, and types
2. **Consistent Data Fetching**: Standardized patterns using React Query
3. **Role-Based Access Control**: Proper RBAC implementation throughout
4. **API Compatibility**: Full compatibility with v3 API specification

### Issue Management Workflows

#### Common Issue Lifecycle Patterns
1. **Bug Report Workflow**:
   - Create issue with `bug` label
   - Assign to developer
   - Update with investigation findings
   - Close when fixed with `state_reason: "completed"`

2. **Feature Request Workflow**:
   - Create issue with `enhancement` label
   - Add to milestone for planning
   - Update with implementation details
   - Close when feature is deployed

3. **Documentation Task**:
   - Create issue with `documentation` label
   - Assign to technical writer
   - Update with progress
   - Close when documentation is complete

#### Bulk Operations
```bash
# Get all open issues for bulk processing
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     "https://api.github.com/repos/dhirmadi/mwapclient/issues?state=open&per_page=100" \
     | jq '.[] | {number: .number, title: .title, labels: [.labels[].name]}'

# Close multiple issues (requires scripting)
for issue_number in 32 33 34; do
  curl -X PATCH \
    -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
    https://api.github.com/repos/dhirmadi/mwapclient/issues/$issue_number \
    -d '{"state": "closed"}'
done
```

### GitHub API Best Practices

#### Rate Limiting
- **Authenticated requests**: 5,000 requests per hour
- **Check rate limit**: `curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/rate_limit`
- **Headers to monitor**: `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`

#### Error Handling
- **HTTP 404**: Issue not found or no access
- **HTTP 422**: Validation failed (invalid data)
- **HTTP 403**: Rate limit exceeded or insufficient permissions
- **Always check response status** before processing data

#### Security Considerations
- **Never log GITHUB_TOKEN** in scripts or outputs
- **Use minimal permissions** for tokens
- **Validate input data** before API calls
- **Handle sensitive information** in issue bodies carefully

### Common Query Patterns

#### Filter Examples
```bash
# Issues created in last 7 days
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     "https://api.github.com/repos/dhirmadi/mwapclient/issues?since=$(date -d '7 days ago' -Iseconds)"

# Issues with specific labels
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     "https://api.github.com/repos/dhirmadi/mwapclient/issues?labels=bug,critical"

# Issues assigned to specific user
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     "https://api.github.com/repos/dhirmadi/mwapclient/issues?assignee=dhirmadi"

# Closed issues
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     "https://api.github.com/repos/dhirmadi/mwapclient/issues?state=closed"
```

#### Useful jq Filters
```bash
# Extract issue numbers and titles
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     https://api.github.com/repos/dhirmadi/mwapclient/issues \
     | jq '.[] | {number: .number, title: .title}'

# Count issues by label
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     https://api.github.com/repos/dhirmadi/mwapclient/issues \
     | jq '[.[] | .labels[].name] | group_by(.) | map({label: .[0], count: length})'

# Get issues updated in last 24 hours
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
     https://api.github.com/repos/dhirmadi/mwapclient/issues \
     | jq --arg date "$(date -d '1 day ago' -Iseconds)" \
     '.[] | select(.updated_at > $date) | {number: .number, title: .title, updated: .updated_at}'
```
