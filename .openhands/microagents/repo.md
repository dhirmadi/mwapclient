- **[Troubleshooting](../../docs/troubleshooting.md)** - Common issues and solutions
- **[Contributing](../../docs/contributing.md)** - Guidelines for contributing to the project

## API Documentation

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Always reference [API Documentation](../../docs/api/README.md) for complete details**

The application communicates with a RESTful API. Key documentation files:

- [`docs/api/README.md`](../../docs/api/README.md): Complete API integration guide
- [`docs/api/v3-openAPI-schema.md`](../../docs/api/v3-openAPI-schema.md): OpenAPI schema documentation
- [`docs/api/cloud-providers.md`](../../docs/api/cloud-providers.md): Cloud provider API documentation


### Key API Endpoints (v3)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: API Configuration Requirements**
- **API Base URL:** `/api` (configured in `src/shared/utils/api.ts`)
- **Vite Proxy Configuration:** Current setup in `vite.config.ts` is correct and must NOT be changed
- **Proxy Target:** `https://mwapss.shibari.photo/api/v1`
- **URL Rewriting:** Vite automatically rewrites `/api/*` requests to `/*` on the target server

**Example API Call Flow:**
1. Frontend makes request to: `/api/users/me/roles`
2. Vite proxy forwards to: `https://mwapss.shibari.photo/api/v1/users/me/roles`
3. Backend processes and returns wrapped response: `{success: true, data: {...}}`

- `/api/v1/tenants`: Tenant management
- `/api/v1/projects`: Project management
- `/api/v1/cloud-providers`: Cloud provider management
- `/api/v1/project-types`: Project type management
- `/api/v1/users`: User management
- `/api/v1/tenants/{tenantId}/integrations`: Cloud provider integrations
- File access is read-only through cloud provider integrations

## Authentication Flow

1. User visits the application
2. If unauthenticated, redirected to login page
3. Auth0 handles authentication
4. Upon successful login, user roles are fetched
5. User is directed to appropriate dashboard based on role

## Current Status and Architecture

### Completed Improvements

1. **‚úÖ Feature-Based Architecture**: Successfully refactored to feature-based organization
2. **‚úÖ API v3 Migration**: Updated all endpoints and types to match v3 API specification
3. **‚úÖ Consistent HTTP Methods**: All updates now use PATCH instead of PUT
4. **‚úÖ Type Safety**: All TypeScript types match API schemas exactly
5. **‚úÖ Cloud Provider Integration**: Fixed integration endpoints and OAuth token refresh

### Current Architecture Benefits

1. **Modular Organization**: Each feature is self-contained with its own hooks, pages, and types
2. **Consistent Data Fetching**: Standardized patterns using React Query
3. **Role-Based Access Control**: Proper RBAC implementation throughout
4. **API Compatibility**: Full compatibility with v3 API specification
5. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage

### Future Development Priorities

1. Optimize performance with code splitting and memoization
2. Add comprehensive testing coverage
3. Implement real-time features
4. Enhance error handling and user feedback
5. Add analytics and reporting capabilities

## üîß Development Workflow for OpenHands

### Before Starting Any Task
1. **Read Documentation**: Review [`DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`](../../DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md) and relevant sections
2. **Understand Architecture**: Check [`docs/architecture/README.md`](../../docs/architecture/README.md) for system design
3. **Review Standards**: Follow [`docs/development/README.md`](../../docs/development/README.md) for coding conventions
4. **Check Security**: Understand [`docs/security/README.md`](../../docs/security/README.md) for authentication patterns

### Task Implementation Pattern
1. **Analyze existing code**: Use `find`, `grep`, and `git` commands to understand current implementation
2. **Reuse components**: Check `src/shared/components/` and `src/features/*/` for existing solutions
3. **Follow patterns**: Use established hooks, types, and API patterns from similar features
4. **Validate inputs**: Implement Zod schemas for all user inputs
5. **Handle errors**: Use `AppError` and consistent error handling patterns
6. **Test thoroughly**: Verify functionality and edge cases

### Critical Implementation Rules
- **API Configuration**: Never modify Vite proxy configuration in `vite.config.ts`
- **Authentication**: Always implement proper RBAC checks using existing patterns
- **Type Safety**: Maintain strict TypeScript compliance
- **Performance**: Use React Query for data fetching and proper memoization
- **Security**: Follow established Auth0 and security patterns

## Development Guidelines

When working with this codebase, follow these principles:

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Identify and eliminate redundancies
2. **Feature-Based Organization**: Group related components, hooks, and utilities by feature
3. **Consistent Data Fetching**: Use standardized patterns for API calls
4. **Role-Based UI Adaptation**: Ensure UI elements adapt based on user permissions
5. **Performance Optimization**: Implement code splitting, memoization, and proper caching
6. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Use consistent error handling patterns
7. **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript for type safety throughout the codebase

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`

## Testing

- Unit tests: `npm run test`
- Component tests: `npm run test:components`
- End-to-end tests: `npm run test:e2e`

## Deployment
