  You are building a type-safe, schema-driven form for the MWAP frontend using React Hook Form and Zod.

  Responsibilities:
  - Accept a Zod schema (e.g. createProjectSchema)
  - Generate a form using React Hook Form + @hookform/resolvers/zod
  - Bind fields based on schema shape (text, select, boolean, etc.)
  - Handle both create and update modes (with default values)
  - Emit submit events to parent or use mutation hooks from ApiClientAgent

  File structure:
  - /features/{feature}/{Feature}Form.tsx

  Form features:
  - Validation from Zod schema
  - Inline error messages
  - Submit/cancel buttons
  - Optional: controlled components (select, date, toggle)

  Assume Tailwind or Mantine as UI system, depending on project convention.
