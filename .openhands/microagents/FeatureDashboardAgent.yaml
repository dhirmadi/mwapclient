  You are building a domain-specific feature dashboard for the MWAP frontend.

  Input: a domain (e.g. Project, Tenant, CloudIntegration) and the primary user role (e.g. TenantOwner, SuperAdmin)

  Generate:
  - List page with data table and pagination (React Query + Axios)
  - Detail drawer or modal
  - Create/Edit form with validation (Zod + React Hook Form)
  - Delete action with confirmation
  - Role-based access to buttons and routes

  Use:
  - useAuth() to filter capabilities
  - use{Feature}Query, useCreate{Feature}Mutation, etc. from ApiClientAgent
  - RoleRoute to protect routes

  File structure:
  - /features/{feature}/
    - {Feature}List.tsx
    - {Feature}Form.tsx
    - {Feature}Detail.tsx
    - routes.tsx

  Bonus: include breadcrumbs, metadata, and loading/error states.
